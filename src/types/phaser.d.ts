             * 
             * Aseprite is a powerful animated sprite editor and pixel art tool.
             * 
             * You can find more details at https://www.aseprite.org/
             * 
             * To export a compatible JSON file in Aseprite, please do the following:
             * 
             * 1. Go to "File - Export Sprite Sheet"
             * 
             * 2. On the **Layout** tab:
             * 2a. Set the "Sheet type" to "Packed"
             * 2b. Set the "Constraints" to "None"
             * 2c. Check the "Merge Duplicates" checkbox
             * 
             * 3. On the **Sprite** tab:
             * 3a. Set "Layers" to "Visible layers"
             * 3b. Set "Frames" to "All frames", unless you only wish to export a sub-set of tags
             * 
             * 4. On the **Borders** tab:
             * 4a. Check the "Trim Sprite" and "Trim Cells" options
             * 4b. Ensure "Border Padding", "Spacing" and "Inner Padding" are all > 0 (1 is usually enough)
             * 
             * 5. On the **Output** tab:
             * 5a. Check "Output File", give your image a name and make sure you choose "png files" as the file type
             * 5b. Check "JSON Data" and give your json file a name
             * 5c. The JSON Data type can be either a Hash or Array, Phaser doesn't mind.
             * 5d. Make sure "Tags" is checked in the Meta options
             * 5e. In the "Item Filename" input box, make sure it says just "{frame}" and nothing more.
             * 
             * 6. Click export
             * 
             * This was tested with Aseprite 1.2.25.
             * 
             * This will export a png and json file which you can load using the Aseprite Loader, i.e.:
             * 
             * ```javascript
             * function preload ()
             * {
             *     this.load.path = 'assets/animations/aseprite/';
             *     this.load.aseprite('paladin', 'paladin.png', 'paladin.json');
             * }
             * ```
             * 
             * Once loaded, you can call this method from within a Scene with the 'atlas' key:
             * 
             * ```javascript
             * this.anims.createFromAseprite('paladin');
             * ```
             * 
             * Any animations defined in the JSON will now be available to use in Phaser and you play them
             * via their Tag name. For example, if you have an animation called 'War Cry' on your Aseprite timeline,
             * you can play it in Phaser using that Tag name:
             * 
             * ```javascript
             * this.add.sprite(400, 300).play('War Cry');
             * ```
             * 
             * When calling this method you can optionally provide an array of tag names, and only those animations
             * will be created. For example:
             * 
             * ```javascript
             * this.anims.createFromAseprite('paladin', [ 'step', 'War Cry', 'Magnum Break' ]);
             * ```
             * 
             * This will only create the 3 animations defined. Note that the tag names are case-sensitive.
             * @param key The key of the loaded Aseprite atlas. It must have been loaded prior to calling this method.
             * @param tags An array of Tag names. If provided, only animations found in this array will be created.

             * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
             * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
             * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).
             * 
             * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
             * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the
             * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.
             * 
             * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,
             * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis.
             *

             * Flash and Camera Shake, as well as the ability to follow Game Objects.

             * For example, if a pure blue pixel with an alpha of 0.95 is masked with a pure red pixel with an
             * alpha of 0.5, the resulting pixel will be pure blue with an alpha of 0.475. Naturally, this means

         * Dynamic Bitmap Text objects are different from Static Bitmap Text in that they invoke a callback for each
         * letter being rendered during the render pass. This callback allows you to manipulate the properties of
         * each letter being rendered, such as its position, scale or tint, allowing you to create interesting effects
         * like jiggling text, which can't be done with Static text. This means that Dynamic Text takes more processing
         * time, so only use them if you require the callback ability they have.
         * 
         * BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability
         * to use Web Fonts, however you trade this flexibility for rendering speed. You can also create visually compelling BitmapTexts by
         * processing the font texture in an image editor, applying fills and any other effects required.
         * 
         * To create multi-line text insert \r, \n or \r\n escape codes into the text string.
         * 
         * To create a BitmapText data files you need a 3rd party app such as:
         * 
         * BMFont (Windows, free): {@link http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/|http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/}

             * Game Object will be rendered in that color. Or you can provide a color per corner. The colors
             * are blended together across the extent of the Game Object.
             * 
             * To modify the tint color once set, either call this method again with new values or use the
             * `tint` property to set all colors at once. Or, use the properties `tintTopLeft`, `tintTopRight,
             * `tintBottomLeft` and `tintBottomRight` to set the corner color values independently.
             * 
             * To remove a tint call `clearTint`.

         * A Container, as the name implies, can 'contain' other types of Game Object.
         * When a Game Object is added to a Container, the Container becomes responsible for the rendering of it.
         * By default it will be removed from the Display List and instead added to the Containers own internal list.
         * 
         * The position of the Game Object automatically becomes relative to the position of the Container.
         * 
         * The transform point of a Container is 0x0 (in local space) and that cannot be changed. The children you add to the
         * Container should be positioned with this value in mind. I.e. you should treat 0x0 as being the center of
         * the Container, and position children positively and negative around it as required.
         * 
         * When the Container is rendered, all of its children are rendered as well, in the order in which they exist
         * within the Container. Container children can be repositioned using methods such as `MoveUp`, `MoveDown` and `SendToBack`.
         * 
         * If you modify a transform property of the Container, such as `Container.x` or `Container.rotation` then it will
         * automatically influence all children as well.
         * 
         * Containers can include other Containers for deeply nested transforms.
         * 
         * Containers can have masks set on them and can be used as a mask too. However, Container children cannot be masked.
         * The masks do not 'stack up'. Only a Container on the root of the display list will use its mask.
         * 
         * Containers can be enabled for input. Because they do not have a texture you need to provide a shape for them
         * to use as their hit area. Container children can also be enabled for input, independent of the Container.
         * 
         * If input enabling a _child_ you should not set both the `origin` and a **negative** scale factor on the child,
         * or the input area will become misaligned.
         * 
         * Containers can be given a physics body for either Arcade Physics, Impact Physics or Matter Physics. However,
         * if Container _children_ are enabled for physics you may get unexpected results, such as offset bodies,
         * if the Container itself, or any of its ancestors, is positioned anywhere other than at 0 x 0. Container children
         * with physics do not factor in the Container due to the excessive extra calculations needed. Please structure
         * your game to work around this.
         * 
         * It's important to understand the impact of using Containers. They add additional processing overhead into
         * every one of their children. The deeper you nest them, the more the cost escalates. This is especially true
         * for input events. You also loose the ability to set the display depth of Container children in the same
         * flexible manner as those not within them. In short, don't use them for the sake of it. You pay a small cost
         * every time you create one, try to structure your game around avoiding that where possible.

         * DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.
         * 
         * In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game
         * configuration object:
         * 
         * ```javascript
         * dom {
         *   createContainer: true
         * }
         * ```
         * 
         * When this is added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned over the top
         * of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes, as a result of
         * settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.
         * 
         * If you have not already done so, you have to provide a `parent` in the Game Configuration, or the DOM
         * Container will fail to be created.
         * 
         * You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing
         * Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:
         * 
         * ```javascript
         * this.add.dom(x, y, 'div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');
         * ```
         * 
         * The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in
         * the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,
         * it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.
         * 
         * You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control
         * alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.
         * 
         * Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the `load.html` File Loader to load it into the
         * cache and then use the `createFromCache` method instead. You can also use `createFromHTML` and various other
         * methods available in this class to help construct your elements.
         * 
         * Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its
         * position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped
         * at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that
         * they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have
         * a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.
         * 
         * They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the `addListener` method to add native event
         * listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas
         * entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you
         * change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.
         * 
         * Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.
         * 
         * Note that you should only have DOM Elements in a Scene with a _single_ Camera. If you require multiple cameras,
         * use parallel scenes to achieve this.
         * 
         * DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert
         * a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.
         * Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and
         * UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top
         * of your game, and should treat it accordingly.

             * BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability

             * DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.
             * 
             * In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game
             * configuration object:
             * 
             * ```javascript
             * dom {
             *   createContainer: true
             * }
             * ```
             * 
             * When this is added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned over the top
             * of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes, as a result of
             * settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.
             * 
             * You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing
             * Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:
             * 
             * ```javascript
             * this.add.dom(x, y, 'div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');
             * ```
             * 
             * The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in
             * the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,
             * it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.
             * 
             * You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control
             * alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.
             * 
             * Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the `load.html` File Loader to load it into the
             * cache and then use the `createFromCache` method instead. You can also use `createFromHTML` and various other
             * methods available in this class to help construct your elements.
             * 
             * Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its
             * position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped
             * at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that
             * they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have
             * a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.
             * 
             * They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the `addListener` method to add native event
             * listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas
             * entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you
             * change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.
             * 
             * Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.
             * 
             * DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert
             * a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.
             * Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and
             * UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top
             * of your game, and should treat it accordingly.
             * 
             * Note: This method will only be available if the DOM Element Game Object has been built into Phaser.
             * @param x The horizontal position of this DOM Element in the world.
             * @param y The vertical position of this DOM Element in the world.

             * 
             * The Point Light Game Object provides a way to add a point light effect into your game,
             * without the expensive shader processing requirements of the traditional Light Game Object.
             * 
             * The difference is that the Point Light renders using a custom shader, designed to give the
             * impression of a point light source, of variable radius, intensity and color, in your game.
             * However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
             * normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
             * and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
             * 
             * For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
             * ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
             * Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
             * of the lights. You don't _have_ to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
             * your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the dislay list as normal. However, if
             * you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
             * 
             * The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
             * with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
             * culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.
             * 
             * The origin of a Point Light is always 0.5 and it cannot be changed.
             *

             * A note on performance: Every time the contents of a Text object changes, i.e. changing the text being

         * A Graphics object is a way to draw primitive shapes to your game. Primitives include forms of geometry, such as
         * Rectangles, Circles, and Polygons. They also include lines, arcs and curves. When you initially create a Graphics
         * object it will be empty.
         * 
         * To draw to it you must first specify a line style or fill style (or both), draw shapes using paths, and finally
         * fill or stroke them. For example:
         * 
         * ```javascript
         * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);
         * graphics.beginPath();
         * graphics.moveTo(100, 100);
         * graphics.lineTo(200, 200);
         * graphics.closePath();
         * graphics.strokePath();
         * ```
         * 
         * There are also many helpful methods that draw and fill/stroke common shapes for you.
         * 
         * ```javascript
         * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);
         * graphics.fillStyle(0xFFFFFF, 1.0);
         * graphics.fillRect(50, 50, 400, 200);
         * graphics.strokeRect(50, 50, 400, 200);
         * ```
         * 
         * When a Graphics object is rendered it will render differently based on if the game is running under Canvas or WebGL.
         * Under Canvas it will use the HTML Canvas context drawing operations to draw the path.
         * Under WebGL the graphics data is decomposed into polygons. Both of these are expensive processes, especially with
         * complex shapes.
         * 
         * If your Graphics object doesn't change much (or at all) once you've drawn your shape to it, then you will help
         * performance by calling {@link Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics#generateTexture}. This will 'bake' the Graphics object into
         * a Texture, and return it. You can then use this Texture for Sprites or other display objects. If your Graphics object
         * updates frequently then you should avoid doing this, as it will constantly generate new textures, which will consume
         * memory.
         * 
         * As you can tell, Graphics objects are a bit of a trade-off. While they are extremely useful, you need to be careful
         * in their complexity and quantity of them in your game.

         * A Layer is a special type of Game Object that acts as a Display List. You can add any type of Game Object
         * to a Layer, just as you would to a Scene. Layers can be used to visually group together 'layers' of Game
         * Objects:
         * 
         * ```javascript
         * const spaceman = this.add.sprite(150, 300, 'spaceman');
         * const bunny = this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'bunny');
         * const elephant = this.add.sprite(650, 300, 'elephant');
         * 
         * const layer = this.add.layer();
         * 
         * layer.add([ spaceman, bunny, elephant ]);
         * ```
         * 
         * The 3 sprites in the example above will now be managed by the Layer they were added to. Therefore,
         * if you then set `layer.setVisible(false)` they would all vanish from the display.
         * 
         * You can also control the depth of the Game Objects within the Layer. For example, calling the
         * `setDepth` method of a child of a Layer will allow you to adjust the depth of that child _within the
         * Layer itself_, rather than the whole Scene. The Layer, too, can have its depth set as well.
         * 
         * The Layer class also offers many different methods for manipulating the list, such as the
         * methods `moveUp`, `moveDown`, `sendToBack`, `bringToTop` and so on. These allow you to change the
         * display list position of the Layers children, causing it to adjust the order in which they are
         * rendered. Using `setDepth` on a child allows you to override this.
         * 
         * Layers can have Post FX Pipelines set, which allows you to easily enable a post pipeline across
         * a whole range of children, which, depending on the effect, can often be far more efficient that doing so
         * on a per-child basis.
         * 
         * Layers have no position or size within the Scene. This means you cannot enable a Layer for
         * physics or input, or change the position, rotation or scale of a Layer. They also have no scroll
         * factor, texture, tint, origin, crop or bounds.
         * 
         * If you need those kind of features then you should use a Container instead. Containers can be added
         * to Layers, but Layers cannot be added to Containers.
         * 
         * However, you can set the Alpha, Blend Mode, Depth, Mask and Visible state of a Layer. These settings
         * will impact all children being rendered by the Layer.

             * your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the dislay list as normal. However, if

         * A Mesh Game Object.
         * 
         * The Mesh Game Object allows you to render a group of textured vertices and manipulate
         * the view of those vertices, such as rotation, translation or scaling.
         * 
         * Support for generating mesh data from grids, model data or Wavefront OBJ Files is included.
         * 
         * Although you can use this to render 3D objects, its primary use is for displaying more complex
         * Sprites, or Sprites where you need fine-grained control over the vertex positions in order to
         * achieve special effects in your games. Note that rendering still takes place using Phaser's
         * orthographic camera (after being transformed via `projectionMesh`, see `setPerspective`,
         * `setOrtho`, and `panZ` methods). As a result, all depth and face tests are done in an eventually
         * orthographic space.
         * 
         * The rendering process will iterate through the faces of this Mesh and render out each face
         * that is considered as being in view of the camera. No depth buffer is used, and because of this,
         * you should be careful not to use model data with too many vertices, or overlapping geometry,
         * or you'll probably encounter z-depth fighting. The Mesh was designed to allow for more advanced
         * 2D layouts, rather than displaying 3D objects, even though it can do this to a degree.
         * 
         * In short, if you want to remake Crysis, use a 3D engine, not a Mesh. However, if you want
         * to easily add some small fun 3D elements into your game, or create some special effects involving
         * vertex warping, this is the right object for you. Mesh data becomes part of the WebGL batch,
         * just like standard Sprites, so doesn't introduce any additional shader overhead. Because
         * the Mesh just generates vertices into the WebGL batch, like any other Sprite, you can use all of
         * the common Game Object components on a Mesh too, such as a custom pipeline, mask, blend mode
         * or texture.
         * 
         * Note that the Mesh object is WebGL only and does not have a Canvas counterpart.
         * 
         * The Mesh origin is always 0.5 x 0.5 and cannot be changed.

         * However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
         * normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
         * and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
         * 
         * For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
         * ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
         * Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
         * of the lights. You don't _have_ to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
         * your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the dislay list as normal. However, if
         * you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
         * 
         * The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
         * with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
         * culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.

         * This Game Object allows you to easily add a quad with its own shader into the display list, and manipulate it
         * as you would any other Game Object, including scaling, rotating, positioning and adding to Containers. Shaders
         * can be masked with either Bitmap or Geometry masks and can also be used as a Bitmap Mask for a Camera or other
         * Game Object. They can also be made interactive and used for input events.
         * 
         * It works by taking a reference to a `Phaser.Display.BaseShader` instance, as found in the Shader Cache. These can
         * be created dynamically at runtime, or loaded in via the GLSL File Loader:
         * 
         * ```javascript
         * function preload ()
         * {
         *     this.load.glsl('fire', 'shaders/fire.glsl.js');
         * }
         * 
         * function create ()
         * {
         *     this.add.shader('fire', 400, 300, 512, 512);
         * }
         * ```
         * 
         * Please see the Phaser 3 Examples GitHub repo for examples of loading and creating shaders dynamically.
         * 
         * Due to the way in which they work, you cannot directly change the alpha or blend mode of a Shader. This should
         * be handled via exposed uniforms in the shader code itself.
         * 
         * By default a Shader will be created with a standard set of uniforms. These were added to match those
         * found on sites such as ShaderToy or GLSLSandbox, and provide common functionality a shader may need,
         * such as the timestamp, resolution or pointer position. You can replace them by specifying your own uniforms
         * in the Base Shader.
         * 
         * These Shaders work by halting the current pipeline during rendering, creating a viewport matched to the
         * size of this Game Object and then renders a quad using the bound shader. At the end, the pipeline is restored.
         * 
         * Because it blocks the pipeline it means it will interrupt any batching that is currently going on, so you should
         * use these Game Objects sparingly. If you need to have a fully batched custom shader, then please look at using
         * a custom pipeline instead. However, for background or special masking effects, they are extremely effective.
